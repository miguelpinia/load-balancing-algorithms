# Load balancing algorithms

There are many algorithms for load-balancing in multiprocessor.
In this repository we'll implement the next algorithms:

* Spanning Tree with SIMPLE methodology
* Spanning Tree with Cilk load-balancing algorithm (THE algorithm)
* Spanning Tree with Chese-Lev load-balancing algorithm
* Spanning Tree with Idempotent load-balancing algorithm (FIFO based)
* Spanning Tree with Idempotent load-balancing algorithm (LIFO based)
* Spanning Tree with Idempotent load-balancing algorithm (DEQUE based)
